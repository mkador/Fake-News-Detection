## Project Overview

Fake news has emerged as a critical issue impacting public opinion and trust. This project aims to develop an effective fake news detection system by leveraging machine learning classifiers trained on labeled news datasets.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- numpy
- TfidfVectorizer  (for text to numeric)
- train_test_split
- sklearn.metrics  
- pickle (for model serialization)  

---

## Models Implemented

- **Naive Bayes**  
- **Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)**  
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier**  
- **Logistic Regression**  

Among these, the **Passive Aggressive Classifier** and **LinearSVC** demonstrated the best performance in classification accuracy and were selected for the final model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkador/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled news articles categorized as *real* or *fake*.  
(Include dataset source here, for example:  
- dataset includes to my repository
- it is a balanced dataset
